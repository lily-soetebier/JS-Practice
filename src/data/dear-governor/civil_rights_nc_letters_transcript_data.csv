3,"Letter: Alice H. Estes to Gov. Dan K. Moore, April 7, 1968","Letter expressing opinions on the country's current state of affairs and the issues of discrimination, oppression, and poverty. Includes a letter of response from Governor Moore.",April 07 1968,April 07 1968,"Estes, Alice H.",,white,"Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr ",Pro,View Item,Clean,,"Early Friday morning, in the aftermath of the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, I wrote to my Congressman, Representative Nick Galifianakis, expressing my grief at the murder of this great American and my hope that Mr. Galifianakis, as my representative in Congress, would work to solve the problems of discrimination, oppression, and poverty which threaten to tear apart the very foundations of our country. I also asked that, in particular, he would vote for the civil rights bill now before the House of Representatives. 

During the next two days, after having reflected long and hard upon the meaning of that terrible event, I concluded that it was important for me to express my feelings and thoughts and hopes to as many people as possible who can be influential and effective in helping our whole country to remedy, on both local and national levels, the problems of inequity and injustice which confront the American people today. Accordingly, I am addressing copies of this letter- to my mayor, my governor, my representative, my senators, and my president. 

I concluded also, however, during my reflections and searchings, that it was important that the people to whom I addressed my thoughts know who I am and who I am not so that they might ascertain what segment of this nation I represent. I am not a civil rights worker. I am not a member of any political or social action groups. I have never participated In any demonstrations or protests. I am a native Southerner. I was born and raised in the South, specifically in Raleigh and Greensboro, North Carolina, and in Roanoke, Virginia. My parents are also Southerners: North Carolinian and Georgian. I was raised as a segregationist. I was taught, as were most white Southerners, to distrust and look down upon Negroes and, to a lesser extent, Jews, Catholics, Northerners, and foreigners. As I grew older I began to examine the attitudes I had been taught and I gradually came to abhor and reject them. As I have grown older I have had opportunities to meet people of many races and creeds and I can no longer judge people as groups but only as individuals. 

I do not consider this attitude of judging people as individuals s radical or extremist stance. And although I have a college education and probably an above average income as a laboratory technician at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Durham, in most areas of my life I am a fairly average citizen. But I am concerned about this country of ours which has been so good to me and has provided me with so many opportunities. I am concerned because I have learned over the years that one major reason for my having had the social and educational opportunities that I have had is that I was born white, a circumstance over which I had no control. I am concerned because others, chiefly the Negroes of America, are far less fortunate than I largely due to the environment into which they were born. For the color of their skin, over which they had no control, is the prime reason for their having been born into and kept in a stultifying and oppressive environment. 

Until we truly achieve in America what we whites are taught in our youth already exists and what every Negro knows through daily experience does not exist - a society in which all people have equal opportunities to develop their abilities and personalities to the fullest - normal sensitive white citizens such as myself will continue to be concerned and distressed, Negro citizens will continue to be frustrated and outraged and humiliated, and poverty, ignorance, crime, racial strife, waste, and violence will continue to increase. Already we are seeing widespread violence in the wake of Dr. King's death. I feel sure that he would deplore this violence. But it exists and has existed and will probably increase. And as we are confronted with this violence, we, as reasonably affluent white Americans must ask ourselves: do content satisfied fulfilled people riot and burn and kill? Why is one segment of our society, which we know to have been discriminated against in education, voting, jobs, housing, and social areas for over a hundred years since they were freed from slavery, rising up in violence all over our country? How can a country as powerful and clever and affluent as ours allow such a situation to develop and how long can it continue to ignore the problems and thus perpetuate them? 

I implore you, as I am also imploring in copies of this letter your colleagues who direct various segments of this nation, to exert your capabilities and energies to the fullest to help solve/6hese grave national problems. Act now before men's minds on both sides, black and white, are closed by violence. Act now that America's future may be bright rather than tragic: let the pledges of equal opportunity made by the founders of our country be fulfilled completely for all citizens. 

Sincerely"

Determined to dispense with fruitless rhetoric and to generate responsible and constructive action, the ministers, in a series of study sessions, have hammered out concrete recommendations for social progress, some of which we submit to you in the enclosed Resolution.

We urge your serious consideration to this enclosure and invite your studied response,

God's blessing to you in your important area of service.

Cordially

We recognize that Governor Dan Moore, in the recent crisis, acted decisively and responsibly and would commend him for his level-headedness in this. We also recognize that his re-appointment of Mr. David S. Coltrane at the beginning of his term of office was one of his more significant acts. We feel however that limiting Mr. Coltrane� s duties to being ""one who puts out fires and cools down ashes"" is too limited an approach to the deep-seated racial and economic problems of our day. We feel that the approach has been negative especially in that the advisory committee has been so ""blue-ribbon"" that it does not really know the needs and the feelings of the group it is supposed to be giving advice about. We would ? call upon the governor and all other elected state officials to begin a positive approach to a program which will include a revamping of the objectives of Coltrane� office; a spreading of the membership of his advisory committee to more adequately reflect end deal with the grass-roots problems of both urban and rural sections of our state and the people; and better liaison with every department of state government that they may join with Coltrane �s office in pursuing a positive approach to identifying and dealing with the various aspects of the problem. 

We ask that state officials make available regularly through press releases and other suitable means the current data on employment in the various departments of state government and the national guard; and that this be done by categories, i.e., professional, sub-professional, non-professional, clerical, etc., and that the number of non-white in each category of each department be clearly shown. We also ask that each department of state government make available on the same basis information on the policies and programs it has by which it�s employees may continue to upgrade their skills and proficiency in order to qualify for promotion. 

We call on our elected representatives to confront seriously the need for a revision of our state constitution and our state statute .laws so that there shall be real �quality and justice under law for all people in our state. 

We urge all elected and appointive state officials to give highest priority to seeking better methods of dealing with the inequalities of education, housing and job opportunities too many of the people of our state live with every day."

In Halifax County we are in excess of 60% colored and particularly in the agricultural section of this county where we are close to 70%, we are of course very much disturbed, and while I don't have the answer, I feel that under your wise leadership that there are sufficient men in North Carolina to devise some plan whereby the matter of mixing colored and white children in white schools can be avoided, and I hope you will permit me to suggest that on this Commission there be included men other than educators who will work out a2 solution satisfactory to both the white and colored population, and I therefore hope that you will search the field in Eastern North Carolina for some good level-headed businessmen to serve on this Committee.

In Halifax County we have made wonderful strides in the past six or seven years towards equalizing facilities of the white and colored. We now have in the county six negro high schools and six white high schools, and we have a program which over the next few years will equalize the facilities.

I will be glad to sit with you if necessary in arriving at appointees of this most important undertaking.

While words, memorials, and other symbolic gestures are necessary means of expressing sentiment, sentiment itself can do very little either to redeem a death or to alleviate our frustration over the situations which precipitated the death of Dr, Martin Luther King. His death can only be truly mourned and his tragedy can only be given meaning when it changes the conditions of the living. When a man is sacrificed to a cause, that death can be redeemed only if his cause gains new life. Present events make it imperative, both for our own sakes and Dr. King's, that we prove through actions that the principles for which he lived are viable and can produce effective changes in our society. With this in mind, we, the undersigned, pledge ourselves and request the Governor of the State of North Carolina to pledge himself to bring about the following goals:

1. To reconvene the state legislature to deal effectively with such questions as open housing, the extension of the federal minimum wage to cover all workers in the state, and the repeal of the right-to-work laws. 

2. To deal with urban renewal and welfare complaints. 

3. To implement the measures suggested by the Kerner Report.

Umstead, October 31, 1954",Letter states that desegregated schools would eventually lead to intermarriage between the races.,October 31 1954,October 31 1954,"Bailey, Clarence W.",,white,Brown v. Board of Education,Anti,View Item,Clean,,"I am glad to read in the papers that you have made a satisfactory recovery and that you are able to be back in your office again. I trust that your health will remain good because, certainly, you will need it and many other sources of strength during the coming six months. 

I, as well as most others, have been considerably disturbed since the Supreme Court decision on segregation. I have given it considerable thought, and especially after reading the stated objectives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It seems that the chief objective of that organization is the complete mongrelization of the races, in which case there would be no more white and no more colored. Abolition of segregation in the schools seems to be only a step in their program. 

I do not wish to take anything away from them nor to deprive them of any right of equal opportunity, but at the same time, I feel no obligation to fraternize with them personally or through our children, just to make them feel better. I do not pretend to know just what the outcome is going to be concerning our schools, but if the worst comes to the worst and segregation does have to be abolished in the schools, we have one fort left, and that is separation of the sexes. Under no circumstances, can we in this state ever allow both races and sexes to grow up together in the public schools, to fraternize, and to attend social functions together, because this would gradually eventuate into matrimony and the attainment of their chief objective, mongrelization. The only time to stop that is before it Is too late. Certainly, the Supreme Court could not pass another law and keep us from separating the sexes in public schools. 

I have already talked to Tom Pearsall about this, and I an sure that it is in the minds of many others.

Probably, you had already thought of it long before I mentioned it

With kind regards, I remain Yours very truly

14,"Letter: David W. Stith to Gov. Dan K. Moore, February 21, 1968","Letter regarding concerns over a student protest held in Durham that escalated into a riot on February 15, 1968. The protest was held in response to the \",February 21 1968,February 21 1968,"Stith, David W.",,NA,Orangeburg massacre,NA,View Item,Clean,,"I respectfully request that you use the powers of your office to assist in establishing effective channels of communication between the city government and the people of Durham. It is my feeling that the two groups have reached an impasse. 

The events of Thursday, February 15, 1968, in the City of Durham pointed up the tensions which lie just beneath the surface of the city. It is tension which has built up to explosive proportions and broke out in destructive disorder. These tensions still exist, potentially more explosive than before.

A number of people have made statements in response to this event emphasizing the need to maintain law and order and the determination to control any similar outbreaks in the future. However, none of these people addressed themselves to the real causes of the disorder, those things which produce and maintain the tension. Durham is still ripe for disorders because the tension is still here. It needs only a spark to light the fire. Durham is typical of the cities where riots occurred last summer. Each of these: Watts, Newark, and Detroit, according to the chairman of the President's Study Commission on Riots, was triggered by events involving the police. So also was the event in Durham last Thursday.

In none of these cities has there been decisive action by the city government which would ease the tension. Neither has there been any action to ease the tension in Durham. All these cities are as ripe for riots today as they were last summer. Will they be set off again? Will Durham's tensions be triggered again?

My hope is that this will not happen. But this hope can only be realized through decisive action--words will not suffice. Decisive action must be taken to
reduce and eliminate the tensions which exist. The answer is not in increased and more efficient methods of riot control. Controls such as this do nothing to prevent outbreaks but are only effective in putting down disturbances. The threat of punishment will not stop disorders from breaking out. More people may be jailed or killed in a shorter period of time using these methods but the tensions within the city will
continue to rise.

The answer lies in attacking the root causes of the tensions. Of course, these cannot be overcome quickly but will possibly take years of patient effort. A beginning can be made, however, which will greatly reduce the tension. This beginning is to establish truly meaningful communications between the city government and the people of the city.

Once again I ask for your assistance.

Respectfully yours"

I have been deeply hurt by your stand for segregation. Do you think when the Lord examines a man's soul
He is going to ask the color of his skin? Do you think a man's color should deprive him of any whit of human dignity? Do you think when Christ blessed the children that He bothered to inquire into their
ancestry first? Do you think we can preach democracy to others and refuse to practice it ourselves?

As indicated by the attached clipping, I am sure that you realize that a young man, too young to vote, sent here by outside interests to lead a howling group of teenagers serves no purpose except to stir our people up and to further trie interest of communist and. other outside groups who have no interest whatsoever in our state or people. 

Apparently, persons of the caliber of the young man pictured in this clipping are certainly misguided and suffer from an inferiority complex and are pawns of a larger group who apparently have unlimited capital behind them. 

I do not belong to the KKK and neither have I ever indicated a desire to join that organization, but, the ????! has asked that the state of Forth Carolina revoke the charter of the KKK. I know many people who belong to the KKK who are decent, upright, business and civic leaders and citizens and I feel that the KKK has just as much right if net more in the state of North Carolina than the NAACP. The NAACP has created more discord in the state of North Carolina than the KKK ever has in the history of the world and if the civil rights movement is allowed to continue on its present collision course, it will only serve to drive thousands and thousands of North Carolinians into the ranks of KKK since it is apparent ly the only organization with any semblance of protection from the growing tide of civil liberty withdrawals.

But even this last statement is incorrect, because this crisis is more of an economic than a racial struggle. Negroes in the state of North Carolina have suffered under the legacy of three hundred years of slavery and of another one hundred years of second-class citizenship. They occupy an inferior social position because of their inferior economic status. For example, let me bring your attention to recent publications of the North Carolina Fund, to the many unwed Negro mothers visiting Chapel Hill�s Memorial Hospital, and the exclusive use of Negroes in menial positions among UNC employees. A drive through eastern North Carolina is also revealing. 

Rather than prematurely calling out the National Guard and proclaiming a statewide ban on liquor sales, you might in the future attempt to help the Negro economically and educationally in the myriad ways possible at the present time. You must provide the leadership necessary to calm and educate the white community. You must demonstrate that you are not the tool of the ""establishment,"" as many of your critics have charged. North Carolina presently enjoys a unique opportunity to provide for the nation an example of state action to ameliorate the condition of an unjustly oppressed minority. Recent events indicate that the alternative is violence entailing the destruction of lives and property, possibly of society itself. Please do not fail us who take pride in living in North Carolina.

During the past three days, I saw and felt what life is like in a totalitarian state. I live in Wilmington, N. C. and at 3 p.m. Sunday afternoon, April 7, a curfew was placed on this city and we were forced to remain in our homes while a few demonstrators in certain areas of our city proceeded to harass law enforcement officers with bricks and stones. The local newspaper stated that 70% of the troublemakers were between the ages of 9 and 13 years old. As a result of this small minority, the majority of citizens could not attend church or school or any function for three days. This small minority was confined to a certain section of this city. Why couldn't our law enforcement officers have blocked off these sections of our city, thus confining the troublemakers instead of punishing 93% of the population because of the misbehavior of 7%. Tactics such as these demonstrated by the local officials in confining private citizens are the same actions applied in Communist countries to suppress and restrict individuals. Our enemies are now aware of the ways and means at their disposal to control the movement and rights of private citizens, to control schools and regulate our very activities. 

I am aware of all the arguments made by local government and police officials for enforcing a curfew, but none of these are valid when there were other methods at their disposal for dealing with this problem. We can not allow a small minority to dictate to the majority of law abiding citizens and take our freedoms as they strive to destroy our very way of life. 

As our elected leader, it is your duty and responsibility to protect the rights and preserve the liberty of every citizen. I appeal to you to use whatever power available to you to see that justice is dispensed in our state that law breakers are punished - that decent, law abiding citizens are protected, but not subjected to curfews and restrictions such as those witnessed by us these last few days.

A RESOLUTION by the Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University 

The Faculty Senate of North Carolina State University recoil in shock and sorrow from the violence which has most recently resulted in the death of the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior, and in civil disorders on a scale not previously seen in this country in our lifetimes. Governmental action alone will not suffice to solve the economic and social problems which are among the prime causes of such violence, but the problems must be solved and we see in prompt and comprehensive governmental action a powerful force toward solution. With the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, we believe that, ""Only a commitment to national action on an unprecedented scale can shape a future compatible with the historic ideals of American society."" 

We therefore urge, most respectfully, by copy of this resolution, the President of the United States, the North Carolina delegation in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives, the Governor of North Carolina, and the North Carolina General Assembly, by giving their executive and legislative support, and by using their public and private influence, jointly and severally, to insure prompt enactment of such legislation as may be necessary to effect an early amelioration and continued progress toward an eventual solution of the economic and social problems of the disadvantaged groups among us. Passed by the Faculty Senate 9 April 1968

Byrd expressing opinions on the outbreak of violence throughout the state following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., referencing quotes from Byrd that were published in a Charlotte Observer article from April 6. A photocopy of the article and a letter of response from Governor Moore is included.",April 09 1968,April 09 1968,"Hilton, Juanita S.",,white,"Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr",Anti,View Item,Clean,,"This letter is in response to the enclosed article found in the April 6, 1968, edition of the Charlotte Observer and an appeal to you, Senator Byrd , to continue in your opposition of this useless racial violence. 

My opinions, and I believe the majority of white people in North Carolina, hold greatly with yours. I may even venture to say that the opinions of the employed Negro populace also coincide, for it appears that the working class of Negroes are not the ones who are causing so much of this trouble.

Mr. King was a creator of a volcanic-type violence who usually fled when his creation erupted. My question is why such a man is being given the honors of a martyr, saint, and savior of nan. Why is a man like Mr. King treated with the respect of a holy man? Is he a ""Christ of the Colored People""? 1 think not. I certainly would not honor any man � white or black � who led my people through the nation's streets, who succeeded in burning our homes, and terrorizing my people. What did he hope to gain?- Black power? So wh t exactly is black power? Senator, you and I both know that the Negro American has as many rights as the white American. He can go to any place that you and I can go. As a white, there are many places that I would not be welcome by other whites because of a difference in class, but I certainly do net go parading through the streets, looting, killing, and demanding equal rights. And as far as freedom � what would become of you and me, Senator, if we broke into stores and carried off the proprietors' merchandise? Did Mr. King hope to put the Negro in the top positions of the nation... by violence? Do they net stop to realize that these positions � yours, for example � are attained only after years of working and struggling toward a goal? Does the Negro expect to walk into these positions with no education, no polishing, no experience? These things take time.


The Negro must stop and see that true equality will take years of work � net years of marching. And even then, there can never he true equality in any society, regardless of color. There is no Utopia. Society does not permit true equality even among the elite. It may not come in my life-time, but eventually, these problems could be solved in a peaceful end. It is evident to me that the trouble is caused by the Negro populace who are unemployed, Senator. It is not the working class of people who are disorderly, Senator. I attended college with Negroes, and believe me, those who are trying to better themselves are not the ones who are out rioting � they don't have time. I do not believe anyone could have prejudice toward the ones who are trying to learn and work and be broad minded. These Negroes have my profound respect. Therefore, Senator, make an appeal to these people to work their minds instead of their feet and their trigger finger! 

Senator, I am twenty-one years old and engaged to be married. Right now the question comes to my mind as to whether I have the right to marry and bring children into a nation where it is not safe for a woman to be out alone, a nation whose people are buying and using weapons against each other, a nation filled with hate and war. I am a true American and proud to be an American. I am engaged to a United States Marine who has served his country well, who was wounded twice in Vietnam for you, for your children, your fellow Senators, and yes, even for Martin Luther King. The Negro race seems little concerned about this aspect. Suppose we bring home all our beys and send those to Vietnam who are so eager to see bloodshed. Believe me, they can see it there, Senator! I am proud to see my flag flying high � but not at half-staff, for a man who makes a mockery of his country, and his God by professing to be a minister. In all this mass confusion of riots and bloodshed, it seems that our boys in Vietnam are forgotten. (The Vietnam news is now found inside the front page of our nation's newspapers.) No one has given our wounded and dead so much glory as Mr. King is receiving. This minute as I write to you, Mr. King's body is being paraded through the streets of Atlanta and the Negroes are marching throughout our nation. If they are truly interested in mourning, why are they not in their churches praying for his soul? Can you imagine how our boys must feel about this pitiful situation? A white soldier and a black soldier fight a war from the same rain-filled bunker for their people who are at home fighting a war with each other. Nauseating, isn't it? 

Senator Byrd, this is election year, and I realize that all of you who are running for re-election will be trying to please the people. But never forget in the process, Senator, to remind your peers, there is a country at stake. Let us not fiddle while Washington burns! Cur country is based on rule by the majority, but it seems to me that the minority have now taken the upper hand. The Negroes are making a farce of the Federal Government.

My appeal, indeed, my plea, is for you, Senator Byrd, to continue your opposition of such nonsensical violence and bloodshed. During this entire mess you are the only man in the Federal Government that I have heard who dared to ""call a spade a spade."" You were the only one who seems to side with the Vast majority of American people. Continued opposition will bring you continued support, I am confident. This is why I appeal to you. Please continue your opposition and try to persuade your fellows that hr. King's way is not the right way for the good of the people � white or black. This violence must be stopped: I am sending a copy of this letter to Governor Moore in the hope that he will quell future violence in the State of North Gudina, and I am also sending a copy to President Johnson. The American people will not stand for this stupidity to be carried out any longer. What will the president do when the whites take up arms? We are having a civil war, Senator! I truly feel that I speak the opinions of the majority. May God lead, guide, and direct you and the other leaders of the America that we love. 

Sincerely yours

The continual calling up of the National Guard and riot police? This creates nothing more than bitter resentment against white authority and it leaves a pervading atmosphere of tension and strife all around. As I rode through Raleigh today, I could sense this embitterment and hostility and it�s a frightening feeling. 

By no means do I condone rioting and violence, but I do not condone social injustice. Martin Luther King's or anyone else's death is no excuse for violence. But should social injustice be met with apathy on the part of those who it is directed against? 

As Governor you must realize that 25% of your constituency is black. Yet, discrimination in schools, housing, interest rates, employment and ""public"" enterprise still exists. North Carolina isn't any better or any worse than the other Southern States in these discriminatory attitudes and their perpetuation (although we are behind other areas of the country in this respect). Do we get much comfort in this fact? I don't!

Why do the North Carolina legislators persist in overlooking the fact that problems exist? Poverty is quite a widespread disease in this state, but one would never know this by listening to the officials who represent us. I'd say that it is a fair estimation to say that the majority of whites in Raleigh have never seen the deplorable conditions which exist in South Raleigh. The fact that urban renewal will occur doesn't amend the fact that 900 families will be displaced and the proposal for the urban renewal project provides housing for only 450 families. Is there justice in displacing people while not providing a place for them to go. 

This state is so wrapped up in its highway program that it has ignored its human program. But I feel that this is not just an oversight, it is 80% intentional. When is something going to be done? When it's too late?! When mass civil disorder occurs? How many more years will the black man have to wait for justice? I don't think we have too many years left. In fact, I would even call that an exaggeration. Months maybe more applicable. 

It is obvious that something should be done now, not one or two months from now. 

As the political head of this state, you should be able and willing to initiate appropriate legislation to alleviate these injustices. I know this is an easy thing to talk about and to propose, but it had better become an easy thing to do. 

The racial crisis is not a Black problem, it's a white problem. With Martin Luther King as the nonviolent buffer between blacks and whites, there was a chance for peaceful restructuring of our social system. This buffer is gone and the chance of peace is almost nonexistent. This is a white problem because white people control this country and have the power to bring about change. This is a white problem because the Commission on Civil Disorders is correct in its evaluation of the cause of disorder � WHITE RACISM. 

Is there any doubt in your mind that severe injustices have and are occurring? Is there any doubt that quality stands for all men -- not just white men � regardless color?? 

Can you as a State Representative sit back and do nothing?? I hope not! I pray not! Social justice is necessary for this nation to survive. Help it survive!!

To inclement this plan, if merit is seen in it, no doubt will require action by your office, and possibly on a federal level. Therefore, I hope you may see fit to give it serious thought. 

Let notices be enclosed with welfare checks and unemployment benefit checks advising that if recipient is apprehended while engaging in a riot or insurrection that it may be reason to deny future benefits. And, in the case of dependent children of welfare families so apprehended, let these families be put on notice that failure by parent or guardian to restrain their children from engaging in such attacks against the very society furnishing them a livelihood, may be reason to suspend future benefits. 

The state now is empowered to suspend or revoke a driver's license if the person holding such a license endangers the lives and property of other citizens on our highways, even though the loss of this license may mean loss of a job. And, in certain cases, rioting and looting can mean loss of citizenship upon conviction. So, unless a welfare check is now sacrosanct, or has become more precious than citizenship, I am of the opinion that families dependent upon our society for a livelihood would cease their attacks, if given such an economic incentive to do so. 

Since the only alternative seems to be by force of arms, I hope you see merit in my suggestion and can devise a means to implement it. Thank you for your consideration.

Further, let us have some special programs to provide employment, income, training, and thus self-respect, for youth. Let us dip into the budget surplus to provide these things rather than merely to pay for quelling riots and rebuilding after wanton destruction resulting from frustration and emotional action.

I am referring to the Supreme Court decision on ""bussing"" made on Tuesday April 20, 1971, headed of course by you. Have you or do you care to hear the feelings of the common people like myself who have children attending public schools concerning ""bussing""? 

Let me make one point clear. Just because I live in North Carolina doesn't mean I'm against integration. For instance, when our children become sick at school, we naturally have to go pick them up. How many children in the poorer areas have parents who can afford to come get their children? Also, nowadays children are engaged in extra activities after school and this means one thing: the parents traveling back and forth. Answer this one, who is going to pay for buses? This money should be used to better and enlarge overcrowded schools. 

It seems apparent to me and every other person I�ve talked with that you are dictated to and possibly being threatened by a handful of NAACP's, Communists and liberals. Its the top people in office today that is tearing our nation and every other nation apart. Its not what the citizens want and need, its always what the top brass wants to dictate. Do you call this Freedom? Do you call this Freedom that my children cannot attend the school of their choice? 

Have you ever talked with children in public schools if they want to leave their friends and neighborhood? I have talked with my three school age children and they say ""no�. 

I think the time has come that issues such as this one should be brought to the public to vote on. Then we would have freedom to vote for our wants and needs. This is the only honest and fair way. 

Do you have grandchildren who attend public schools or do they attend private schools? Believe me, this decision is on the lips of everyone I know who has children and dominates over-the-fence conversations at this time, Right is right and wrong is wrong and in my personal opinion this action is wrong as wrong can possibly be. 

Do you honestly and truly feel you have a cloar conscience in your decision on ""bussing�? Think about it.

Now that the crisis is apparently passed at least for the time being, I sincerely hope that North Carolina will move forward to deal with the major issues that underlie the disturbances of the last week. It was needful to call for the dispelling of strife and for an end to violence, but the matter should not end there. We must now move forward on a positive note to constructive action. 

The action of the Mayor of Winston-Salem last night (April 10) is the kind of action that is needed for our entire state. I would appeal to you as the Governor of North Carolina to consider some such action for the state as a whole. 

As a life-long citizen concerned about our state, I would appeal to you to: 

1. Call upon industry in North Carolina to make a common effort now to find jobs for as many of the unemployed as possible, particularly those in poverty areas. 

2. Call upon the municipalities of North Carolina to form urban coalitions such as Mayor Benton is seeking to establish in Winston-Salem. In this way the cities can seek to deal with their local problems in a positive way. 

3. Call upon the entire state to work for the elimination of other social ills such as inadequate housing for the poor. 

4. Call upon the candidates for public office in this election year to conduct campaigns free of racism. I have followed the campaign of the many candidates carefully in these past weeks. There is much in what I have heard so far that gives rise to fear and misgiving and little that encourages hope. 

It is this latter point that disturbs me most. Too often in North Carolina in recent years politicians are rewarded for their negative stand on race. This leads the candidates to vie with one another in their appeal to prejudice and racial ill will. As example the present candidates for Governor are competing to see who can make the strongest statements on riots and violence. None apparently dares speak at all of our need to deal constructively with the crisis that faces us as a state and nation. Adequate law enforcement is vital, but is this all that needs to be said? 

The time for North Carolina to move to prevent riots next summer is in May and June. It would be a great thing for our state if you, as Governor, in an address to the people would call upon all of us to rise above prejudice and ill will and seek good will, understanding and peace. 

Sincerely yours

Moore, March 25, 1968","Letter including comments and suggestions following attendance of the Governor's Conference on Community Relations, held in Raleigh on February 21, 1968. Includes a letter of response from Governor Moore, which mentions the Good Neighbor Council.",March 19 1968,March 19 1968,"Corpening, Julius H. (Julius Harshaw), 1928-",,NA (white),"Governor's Conference on Community Relations, held in Raleigh on February 21, 1968.",Moderate,View Item,Clean,Church,"Thank you very much for the booklet on the Governor's Conference on Community Relations and for the opportunity of participating in this conference. In light of your enclosed letter inviting comments and suggestions, I am presuming to write to you. 

Very candidly I feel that the conference itself was only a beginning. Unless it is followed up both at the local and state levels, very little will have been accomplished. I realize, of course, that the follow-up is largely up to local communities but I also feel that through your good offices a number of things can be done. 

One thing which I feel is particularly important at both local and state levels is to insure better lines of communication between all facets of the community. In one community, for instance, in a very unofficial, quiet way, a number of businessmen are seeking to enter into conversation with leaders of the more radical elements in the Negro community. It is the feeling of many that this may create better understanding and at least provide some kind of safety valve. As I indicated, this is being done very unofficially and quietly. Any publicity to this kind of thing would damage any positive outcome irreparably. What some are trying to do locally could also be done by you at the state level. For instance, while some would have serious reservations, I would hope that you might invite some people such as Howard Fuller, Ben Ruffin and other such leaders across the state to sit down with you in small groups to discuss the situation with your attitude being simply to listen. I recognize that this is terribly presumptuous for me to even suggest to you. At the same time, the possible help that such informal and unofficial conferences might be is tremendous. 

A second suggestion that might have some possibility is for you through the Good Neighbor Council to sponsor a series of regional conferences on community relations which could serve as models for local communities in dealing with problems. In such conferences you might have the various elements of the community talking with each other to exchange ideas, hammer out possible solutions to problems, but most of all, to attempt to create an atmosphere in which communication could take place. Representation at such meetings might involve city administration, Chamber of Commerce, police, County Commissioners, human relations groups, radical Negro leadership, the church, and other groups. Each community ought to have a way by which these various groups get together; however, few do. A regional conference of this type could provide a kind of model for individual communities to follow. 

Still another possibility that might be helpful is for there to be some kind of clearing house on information as to what various communities are doing to meet their problems. For instance, I heard by way of the grapevine that one city in North Carolina through its United Fund is attempting to provide camping opportunities for ghetto children on an entirely new basis for this summer. I recognize that camping opportunities are small potatoes in terms of the massive problems we face in urban situations. At the same time, this is the kind of gesture of good will and good faith which can go a long way toward alleviating some of the tensions and mistrust which exist. If this kind of information can be communicated to appropriate people, it would enable all of our communities to share in possible projects which could be helpful. This may already be done at a level of which I am unaware. It is an idea which has some merit, I think. 

We are grateful for the leadership you are furnishing in North Carolina, especially for your efforts in this very crucial area of community relations. I am convinced that we as a state are in for serious trouble in the months immediately ahead. Whether or not anything could be done to head off some of the trouble remains to be seen. I do think that it is imperative that everything possible be done in this direction and, if such efforts fail, we will at least have some means by which we can begin to pick up the pieces after the trouble is over.

We did our best I am glad to say we in Henderson, N.C. keep things very quiet. 

In this proposal you will find just what is needed most in thee United Stats of America.

Please feel free to call on us at any time to help you do a good job.

To whom it may concern:

A request was sent out by the Governor to all ministers, and leaders, asking them to use their influence in appealing to the people for peace and order in this time of confusion, over the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

We will gladly do our best to keep peace and order, but quieting those people down at this point will not solve the problem. 

When a baby cries because he is hungry, jumping and rocking him does not satisfy. It may quiet him for a few minutes, but does not take care of the hungry appetite, so it is with the American Negro today. For 300 years we have been crying for freedom, more out let and justice. We have been given token, rocked with promises, and patted on the back, but no longer has this remained sufficient for us. We must continue our fight for what we call a full freedom. 

President Abraham Lincoln heard our cries at the age of 12 and vowed that he would try to bring an end to it. He lit tho torch and started the trail for which we highly appreciate, but he was killed for his good deeds. 

President John F. Kennedy lit the second torch and stepped out to make a home run for justice, according to the will of GOD, but was shot down like a mad dog in the street. 

Dr. Martin Luther King stepped out with President Kennedy for justice for all people. 

President L. B. Johnson has taken up the trail, that President Kennedy left behind. He has stepped out like a man, and is holding tight to this day, he has tried to give the baby the food it needs to grow a healthy strong body. 

Dr. Martin Luther King called for a non-violent program, and was in the line with the President's march through the country asking for nonviolence, for justice for all mankind, justice that has been promised for hundreds of years, but has not been implemented and for the very cause he was shot down like a dog. The torch cannot trail in the dust, it must shine until Freedom, Justice and Equality prevail for all mankind no matter what nationality, what race, creed or color, because this is the will of our Almighty GOD. 

We must fight to establish the following things. 

(1) To establish full fledge, Democracy, a Government with social equality to all people without respect to race. 

(2) To establish such Government, that there be laws requiring that each Legislative body and every Executive body be integrated of all races that are living under the laws that are made by the bodies. 

(3) That complete equality employment to carried out in all business establishments such as, (A) Fire Departments, (B) All Government Offices, (C) All Mail Carriers both rural and city limits, (D) All Post Offices Clerks, (E) All Highway Road Officers be integrated, according to qualifications, (F) All Trucking Firms, (G( All Farm AAA Officers according to qualifications, (H) All Stores Clerks according to qualifications, (i) To completely abolish any type of discrimination, (J) And last but not least to practice full fledge freedom to all people, regardless to race, creed or color.

In order to pursue the goal of closer communion among men of diffrent races, it is obvious that concrete steps must be taken to assure the Negro equal status in every phase of our society from jobs to open housing to education to, if I may say so, open houses of worship. In this regard, I would like to address my congregants in very specific terms. Ahy help that your office can give to me would be most appreciated.

The fact that Negroes have to struggle to achieve their constitutional rights is ridiculous. Not only this, it is abhorrent to those of us who truly believe ""all men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" 

I am a native North Carolinian, and I understand much of what lies behind the prejudice of these people � ignorance, pure and simple. Well, this is to be understood and even tolerated to a certain extent because each generation becomes more educated and enlightened. 

However, the real cause for distress comes when men such as yourself, who hold responsible positions, take narrow-minded views based on expediency. You people have left the ethical yardstick behind and are thinking only of political expediency. 

I wonder if you have read either The Mind of The South by W.J. Cash and The Seeds of Time by Henry Savage? If not, I believe you would find them provocative and enlightening reading. 

However, as well as being Governor of our state and a man who holds a position supposedly connected with the law of the land, you of course have your opinion as an individual citizen. (Even if it is that nothing should be allowed which would interfere with commerce, as you advocated in your press conference of March 9, 1960.) 

This brings me to the real objection I have to your policies. I feel that you have no right to dictate to the various colleges that they tell their students to refrain from taking part in peaceful demonstrations on behalf of civil rights. (also from the press conference of March 9, 1960) I feel this to be an infringement of our civil liberties. We are citizens of the United States and the Constitution (which believe it or not, is the law of the land) guarantees the rights of its people to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly. 

If the adult leaders of state were less bigoted and narrow-minded, the students would not be placed in a situation where by merely trying to preserve their integrity, they are misrepresented as agitators. For you see, there happen to be a few of us who believe that all men are brothers and that the principal thing which Christ had to say was ""Love all mankind"". We happen to believe in the ideals expressed in our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. We believe in the ""American Dream"" and want to make it a reality. 

Besides this aspect of the issue of academic freedom. Instructing students as to why, when, where and over what they may peacefully demonstrate is in direct opposition, to any semblance of academic freedom.

In closing, I would like to advise you that a study of your history book would inform you of the fact that defenders of an outmoded, out-worn, decadent status quo never ultimately succeed. Also remember Victor Hugo, 'An idea whose time has come is stronger than any weapons or any armies�. 

You, my dear sir are defending an outmoded status quo against an idea whose time has indeed come. Really, this is quite a futile and pitiable position in which to find oneself. 

Sincerely

Not that what I say will be of any interest to you or affect your views; but I, as a college student and a citizen of the state, would like to express my opinions anyway. 

In connection with your statement that law and order must be maintained in regard to the sit down strikes, I think that one of the most important elements was left out, namely justice. Let us have law and order, but also let us have justice and nondiscrimination along with them for any person. Let us have the laws enforced by justice including the one passed by the Supreme Court of the United States which did away, supposedly, with legal discrimination in public schools. Hitler and Stalin probably had law and order enforced, but they did not consider justice or nondiscrimination. I stand for law, order, justice, and nondiscrimination against any human being in this matter. I surely am not going to fight for a ""white supremacy� idea that is dying or is dead in the modern world, but I will fight for equal rights under law for all human beings. 

Next, if the university and college is a free academic institution dedicated to the search for truth and to the art of learning, a center of free knowledge, what right, I want to know: has the head of such an institution to control the expression of its members on vital issues which will affect their lives as long as they are not speaking for or representing the university in an official capacity. As a member of the human race and as a peaceful citizen of the state, I think it is my right to express my self on issues of concern to me as long as I do not interfere with the right's of others. I go to college to learn and obtain knowledge that will help me in making decisions not to be told what decisions I have to make. A college student should be mature enough to decide some things for himself, especially what prejudices he wants to have, if any. However, I realize that with the sit down strikes there have been conflicting rights at stake. One person's right to run his own business and cater to whom he pleases, and the other person's right, as a member of the public, to be able to buy anything a store sells, including service, if they have the money and the store sells them other things. I only plead for the students' right and the right of all people in a democracy, supposedly, as a thinking human being to express themselves in their own way as long as they do not interfere with others rights.

I was in Raleigh this week and frankly, I was a bit puzzled as to why the American Flag flying from the State Capital building was not flying at half mast to honor Dr. King. While I realize that we all have our own feelings about events and situations, it seems to me that things of this sort do certainly provoke bitterness and hate among people, regardless of who these people are. This, to me, is a provocation on your part to stir up the people at this time of extreme danger. I am just wondering why a small thing like lowering a flag to half mast would be so difficult for you to do. Certainly, as a Governor of such a great state as North Carolina, you would want to see, especially at this time, harmony among the races. 

Our great Governor, Mills E. Godwin, ordered all flags lowered here in Virginia to half mast with no hesitation whatsoever. 

It is no secret on my part that I am against the mixing of the races, and I am solidly against the looting violence, and burning that has taken place in the many cities of the country, but I can not see for the like of me why the flag was flying at full mast. The state of North Carolina as in Virginia has a large concentration of colored people and in my mind to provoke any further trouble at this time will certainly place all of us in a pretty dangerous position. I would suggest that you must realize that the time, place, and events today are entirely different from some years ago. What I mean by this is that you must be the Governor of all the people or not be the Governor for any. 

I would appreciate your comments on this.

Mr. Governor, there simply are not enough federal troops to occupy and safeguard all of America's towns; and, Heaven forbid, even if there were enough, who can be sure that Negro soldiers will continue an allegiance to a system the majority of whose leaders still speak as if ""law and order"" mean status quo. May the human love and dedication which you seem unable to comprehend but which Negro guardsmen, police and soldiers practice in these dangerous times grow in those men of goodwill. May that growth look over and forgive your constant tendency to overlook their loyalty to these United States of America.

In the meantime, Mr. Governor, you can make some gestures which, though criminally tardy, may so much help even now. Just being noticed would help the corporate feelings of all Negroes in this State. Even as they have already identified variously with white attitudes toward the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Negroes here will beam with pride if you would only appoint a sizeable number of Negroes to some significant state agencies. This gesture will not hurt you, Mr. Governor, but it will help all of us so very much.

Can you imagine for one moment, Mr. Governor, the frustration a Negro youth feels when he sees that his race's most talented men--holding all kinds of terminal degrees from universities all over the nation--can never merit appointment to even a handful of harmless state boards and committees. That gesture can come only from you, Sir.

Force, promise of increasing force, determination to force with force will hardly help us, Mr. Governor. But I urge you to try my suggestion which I make in all seriousness and without malice. Give it a chance, Sir. I cannot be any more wrong than your present course.

",,Black,Brown v Board of Education,Pro,View Item,Clean,NAACP; President of the State Conference of Branches of the NAACP,"On June 4, 1954, the Charlotte Observer carried a news item reporting the Board of Education has unanimously agreed to operate the North Carolina schools just as they have been operated in the past.

May I take this opportunity to remind you that the May 17 decision of the United States Supreme Court announced a principle of constitutional law in clear and unmistakable terms that segregated public
schools are violative of the Constitution of the United States. It seems to us that this places upon our highest State officials a solemn duty of making immediate plans to conform the school system of North Carolina to the principle enunciated by the Supreme Court.

There are, of course, a few problems involved in the adoption and implementation of a statewide plan of desegregation of the public schools as is now required by the Supreme Court's decision. The administrative problems involved in this are relatively easy of solution. This would merely mean that some system would be adopted for the division of the school system among the children of public school age in the state on a fair and equitable basis and without regard to race and color.

The more complex problem which the Supreme Court decision raises is the question of the adaption of the people of the State to a new way of life since we have all been reared in a segregated system. Now we are called upon to change that system into an integrated one, insofar as one of our largest and most important public institutions are concerned--our public schools.

We do not feel that this presents any overwhelming difficulties but it is merely a question of adjustment of the individual to a new outlook. We are certain that the people of our state can make this necessary adjustment without undue friction. It should be pointed out that in every instance where schools have adopted a policy of desegregation, the difficulty which had been anticipated has not taken place.

May I refer you and the members of the Board to a most exhaustive study of this problem which supports this point of view: Clark, Desegregation: An Appraisal of the Evidence, Vol, IX, No. 4, The Journal of Social Issues, 1953.

Even if our confidence in the people of our state is somewhat misplaced with respect to this question, you must agree that you do not deal with the question by delaying it. Race relations in our state have been somewhat better than in most other states of our region, and we are convinced that the citizens of goodwill will be willing to aid and assist state and local officials in adopting and implementing a plan for desegregation of the public schools.

There is no reason why we should wait for the Supreme Court to give some indication whether it will require immediate desegregation or permit gradual desegregation of the public schools. It would be to North Carolina's advantage, if at this time, independent of the United States Supreme Court, it would adopt a plan of desegregation and undertake to insure the public acceptance of its program.

May I remind you that the State of West Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington, D. C.; Greensboro, North Carolina; Topeka, Kansas, and a few other communities have adopted, or, are adopting programs for desegregation without awaiting decision by the United States Supreme Court.

I hope that the Board will reconsider this matter, and will call for the help of citizens of goodwill of both races in the adoption of a program which would implement the principles announced by the Court.

As President of the State Conference of Branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, I am authorized to offer the services of the NAACP to assist you in whatever way it can in devising an effective program for desegregation of the public schools.

REASON TO BE SAD, BUT NO REASON TO RIOT, BURN, AND LOOT:

Many compliments have been bestowed upon the late Dr. Martin Luther King since his assassination last week. I dare not ask the editor of this paper to list all of his noble characteristics again, but I am grateful for the privilege to mention his desire for love to reign over hatred, and peace to triumph over violence.

Many of us question the methods and tactics Dr. King used to help mankind, but thousands upon thousands of people throughout the world have admitted that his motive was good. The many things said
about his determination to overcome evil with good tell us that he a man who worked on hot issues with a cool head.

Martin Luther King, Jr. had the idea that all men should be the recipients of justice and freedom, but he also had the idea that no man should seek after his rights with methods that are not right (rioting, burning, looting, fighting and killing). Throughout the land he taught men to lay aside the weapons of violence and strive for their goals with a more excellent way.

Dr. King used many opportunities to practice what he preached. When a crowd of angry negroes (his race and my race too) gathered to retaliate for the bombing of his home in Montgomery, Alabama, - Dr. King persuaded his people to return to their homes and let peace abide in their hearts. His plea for restraint and order carried the message: THIS EVIL DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. bombed the negro race. All of us feel the effect in one way or another, but I think we need to repeat the message he proclaimed in Montgomery: THIS EVIL
DEED GIVES US NO REASON TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

Shame is upon those who used Dr. King's death for an excuse to riot, burn, and loot. Those who rendered such violence took advantage of a sad occasion to display the hatred that was already planted in their hearts. They have admitted to the world that the doctrine of love which Dr. King upheld had no influence on their lives.

Men of all races who deliberately injure the economic, civil, social, physical, or spiritual welfare of their fellow men - admit to the world that they have rejected the example of Him who was greater that Martin Luther King, Jr. Jesus Christ was that greater one who agave the perfect example as He marched along the shores of Galilee. His followers heard Him say: "".....thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"", ""love our enemies"", and ""...as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise"". Cruel men misunderstood His example, hated His doctrine, and nailed Him to a cross. His prayer on that rugged cross at Calvary tells us that He refused to hate those who hated Him: ""Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do"""
64,"Letter: William Norris to Gov. Dan K. Moore, April 1968",Letter expressing opinions on racial turmoil in North Carolina. Includes a letter of response from Governor Moore.,na,Apr-68,"Norris, William",,white,"Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Riots",Pro,View Item,Clean,Black Power Mentioned,"In this letter I want to take time to express my opinion regarding the nearsighted and non-specific views given recently by your aid Mr. David Coltrane concerning racial turmoil in North Carolina. 

Do you think that North Carolina has had considerable racial violence in recent months due to the fact that it has relatively more Negro college students than most other southern states; or could it possibly be due to the fact that North Carolina has predominantly more educated Negros than most of southern states, who are more aware of the Articles of Confederation, the Bill of Rights, and last the constitution of the United States?

Yes Mr. Moore, you could say that North Carolina has more Negro college students than most other southern states; and because so, there are less ""Uncles called Toms"", who due to ignorance, accept things the way they were and are, who are not aware of their rights and don't know how to rebel against the merciless amounts of white racism that has suppressed them for over 400 years. 

I say to you Mr. Moore that laws cannot change the hearts of people (white racists), and until these change, there is going to be more riots, more violence, and more turmoil. But keep in mind one thing: racial riots are not Black Power motives to destroy the white man and what's his, they are part of a revolution just like the American Revolution of 1775, or the French Revolution of 1789, the Russian Revolution, English, Chinese, etc.

Very truly yours"
65,"Letter: Wilson W. Lee to Gov. Dan K. Moore, May 4, 1968",Letter expressing opinions on law and order and calling for positive action from Governor Moore.,May 4 1968,4-May-68,"Lee, Wilson W.",,NA (Black),"Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,; April 6 Church Letter ",Pro,View Item,Clean,Church,"We are most thankful to you for your telegram, April 6, 1968, in which you appealed for Order in the State. We wholly agree that order must be established in the State, and we pledge our support to its establishment. We further pledge to give ourselves unreservedly to the encouragement of the maintenance of Order.

It is well to note that we have used the word ORDER, rather than the phrase �law and order."" We have done this for two specific reasons. (1) The phrase ""law and order"" is a misnomer in its most honest admission (2) We hold law as a part of Order. It is the latter statement that we shall deal with briefly and appeal to you for your help as Governor of North Carolina and Governor of all the people, black and white.

Law is a part of Order; it is not a part equal with Order such as the phrase ""law and order."" The administration of law is the basic cause for dis-order, whether this administration is in the enactment of laws, or the injustice in their application. In order that we are understood, let us give an example: We have laws in North Carolina for which the penalty is death for their violation -- the black man
has paid this penalty many times for acts committed against white people in North Carolina, but never has a white man paid the death penalty for the very same acts committed against Negroes even though they have been numerous. The failure here was to apply the law justly. It is this injustice and cruelty which has disturbed order and created disorder.

It is not a lack of respect for law. Most men have high respect for law, but we must be honest with you, they have lost confidence in white man to administer it fairly and rightly. Confidence must be rebuilt, faith must be established, and justice must become a reality blind to the color of one's skin. It is here we appeal to you to help us establish Order. We will continue to work for the good of mankind, uninhibitedly by the color of one's skin. We appeal to you as Governor and other officials to help us to make this State, State of justice, not based on race, but on right. We must be equally as candid with you in closing as we have been 'throughout the letter, if we do not arrive at justice without the color of one's skin, children unborn today will hate tomorrow. 

Most honorably yours

67,"Letters from Emily W. Elmore [?] to Gov. Dan K. Moore, March 23, April 24, and April 29, 1968","Three separate letters, sent on March 23, April 24, and April 29, 1968, expressing opinions on the current state of affairs and regarding fears of a communist takeover of North Carolina colleges. Includes 2 pages of clippings from The Review of the News magazine, dated April 10, 1968.",April 24 1968,April 24 1968,"Elmore, Emily W.",,white,Campus Protests,Anti,View Item,Clean,,"I wrote you about 1 month ago that plans were in the working to take over our college campus. Within the next two weeks, 6 campuses were demanding more rights, more privileges, blocking the administrator's building, holding college presidents hostage, marching en mass in the presidents' home, etc. Then Martin Luther King's death -- and our nation was demanding we pay homage, this man whom violence always followed. Merchants were threatened - our local Negro leaders who have done so much to keep power -- others of our youth were threatened of danger if they did not join them. Threats of burning this house were issued too - Congressmen were threated of violence to themselves and families -- if they did not push the bousing bill and I must say our local negros had more stamina than did Congress - yet we should be humbly proud that our N.C. Representatives did not succumb to these threats -- We do have a great State. 

We must realize that all of us are in as much danger as those threatened for no mob stops to ask questions. And when they rally get down to fussing -- they will take no time to issue threats - but will come like a thief in the night (2 false bomb threats in our schools today). Anything to keep everybody stripped up in the mean time to take our mind off the vital issues. 

So I must repeat again - When this gets started again - burning and looting may seem like a small thing - for whether or not their demands are met - they plan to use our college students - black power - ""poverty"" youths to overthrow our government and rid us our ""imperialist attitude"" - Every day now - one or two more colleges and universities and being taken possession of. 

Remember, I stated in last letter that the Student Association President -- Ede Swartz -- had set up outside last Aug and released plans of it in Nov one to remove situations from most campuses -- And that one of our undercover agents had worked as ""undercover"" agent with the Du Bois club - for 2 years - and that he had given distinct proof of their plans to unite all Leftist groups - and that they planned to spill blood in our streets this summer. I also wrote Congressmen of these facts -- No doubt they plan to do this before vacation begins. 

But as usual we are pessimist, extremist, etc. But call us what you will, we are only facing facts - facts - Gov. Moore, and we do not blame our students or those in office in our country. But we know a foreign conspiracy has been working here since 1917 or 19 and this is definitive proof that agents were here in 1902 -- Laying the foundation work for this group - one of the 1st - Warburg, a banker with Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in NYC. His partner Jacob Schiff was not long in sending $20,000 out to the USSR Conspiracy in USSR - which Warburg instead of banking, spent his time in monetary reforms for the U.S.  - which we know is where are intended collapse began. Can anyone of us relieve our selves of blame if our reforms to read the other side of the coin that has so well been kept hidden??

As you know, after considerable investigation last year, I requested that your office use its influence to have Howard Fuller dismissed from the North Carolina Fund. This request was based on documented facts gathered by the Chief Investigator of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee, tying Mr. Fuller in with last summer's violent civil rights outbursts in Durham.

It is my opinion that the North Carolina Fund is involved in many practices that are harmful for the State of North Carolina. The activities of an employee of a grantee organization of the North Carolina Fund such as Mr. Fuller inciting people to take law in their own hands is inexcusable and must be stopped.

As a U.S. Congressman and a concerned citizen, I urgently request the Governor's office to begin an immediate investigation into the activities of the North Carolina Fund and its grantee agencies. I am also writing the Director of the North Carolina Fund, Mr. George Esser urging the dismissal of Howard Fuller, an employee of the Foundation for Community Development.

I feel that this is a very serious problem confronting North Carolina, and I would hope that you would use the influence of your office to investigate this organization, particularly to see if certain activities by the North Carolina Fund are in violation of the North Carolina Charter. I am sure that you share my concern that no person or group receiving federal money should be allowed to operate under a tax free shelter and at the same time advocate violence.

Sincerely yours"

71h,"Letters and Telegrams regarding the Protests of High School Students in Swanquarter, NC","Includes eight letters and telegrams regarding two incidents in November 1968 in Swanquarter, NC. On November 8, approximately 150 young demonstrators, who dubbed themselves the ""Martin Luther King Nonviolent Crusade,"" were protesting recent cuts to welfare payments inside of the county welfare office when they were tear-gassed and sprayed with Mace. Approximately 20 of those protesters continued their demonstration a few days later on November 11 inside the Hyde County Courthouse, where witnesses claim officers threw smoke and tear gas grenades into the room with the protesters and closed off the room so those inside were not able to escape. Tensions had been building in Swanquarter for months leading to these incidents from forced school desegregation and the closure of historically black schools. This collection of letters and telegrams includes a letter from Dr. Herbert H. Blumberg of Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania on November 9, 1968; telegram sent by Ray Thompson of the United Presbyterian Church in Durham on November 11, 1968; letter with an attached newspaper clipping sent by Mrs. Hugh Kelly on November 12, 1968; telegram sent by J. J. Blum, Vice President of the Durham Council on Human Relations, on November 12, 1968; telegram sent by Dr. Elmer L. Severinghaus of the United Church Board for World Ministries in Greensboro on November 13, 1968; telegram sent by Alexander B.
